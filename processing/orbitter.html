                            <p>Genetic algorithm: dots attempt to launch from and orbit around the center blue planet. Achieving orbit is simple, so the algorithm attempts the largest possible orbit. This is defined by a formula between the mean distance as the dot orbits around the planet and the roundness of the orbit, determined by the difference between the closest and furthest distance away from the planet (range). The larger the number, the higher the "weight", which is used to determine the best dot of the generation. The variables of this genetic algorithm is the probability of crossover between two parents, probability of mutation with each frame, and probability of a random amount of fuel.</p>
                            <p>After running the program for 24 hours, in the 4414th generation, a weight of 458.2152 was achieved with a mean distance of 448.03256 and a range of 1.6021423. I should have implemented a way of graphing the max weight achieved over time, but didn't think of it at the time. The lowest weight possible is around 250, and the program reaches a weight of 300 around the 10th generation.</p>
                            <p>Click and hold to see the trail of the dots, press 'w' to toggle continue running the generation after all the data is recorded, press 'r' to reset the program. I was too lazy to implement changing the variables during runtime, so no controls for that.</p>
